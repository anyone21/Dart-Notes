## Commenting Code
We can document our code through the use of commnets. These allow us to write any text directly along side our code and are ignored by the compiler.
Different types of comments in Dart:
* Single line comment
```Dart
void main(){
  //This is a single line comment
}
```

* Block line comment
```Dart
  /* 
    This is a multi-line comment.
    This can comment multiple lines.
  */
```

* Documentation comments
```Dart
  /// These comments begin with ///, these comments are used to add documnetation comments to our code
```

## Statements and Expression
* **Statements** : It is a command, something we tell the computer to do. For example:
```Dart
 void main(){
    print("Hello, World");  //This is a statement
```

* **Expressions** : An expression doesn't do something; it is something. That is, an expression is a value, or is something that can be calculated as a value.
```Dart
void main(){
  8*565
  x
  'Hey, I am an expression';
```
