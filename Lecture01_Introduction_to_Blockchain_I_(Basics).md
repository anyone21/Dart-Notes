# What is a Blockchain?
A decentralized computation and information sharing platform that enables multiple authoritive domains, who do not trust each other, to cooperate, 
coordinate and collaborate in a rational decision making process.

## Problem with a centralized system:
* If we do not have sufficient bandwidth to load google docs, we'll not be able to edit.
* What if the server crashes? Then we lost all our data.

### Centralized vs Decentralized vs Distributed

* **Decentralized: ** Multiple points of coordination.
* **Distributed: ** Everyone collectively execute the job.
