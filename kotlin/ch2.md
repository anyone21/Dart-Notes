### Few things about CPU
* At the heart of a computer is a Central Processing Unit (CPU).This is essentially a math machine. It performs addition, subtraction, and other arithmetical
operations on numbers.
* The CPU stores the numbers it acts upon in small memory units called **registers**.
* The CPU is able to read numbers into registers from the computerâ€™s main memory, known as **Random Access Memory (RAM)**.

### MINI-Exercises:

```kotlin
fun main(){
    //1 
   	val myAge:Int = 24
    println(myAge)
    
    //2
    var averageAge:Double = 24.0
    averageAge = (averageAge+30)/2
    println(averageAge)
    
    //3
    val testNumber:Int = 45
    val evenOdd:Int = testNumber%2
    println(evenOdd)
    testNumber = 60  //Error : val cannot be assigned
    
    //4 
    var answer = 0
    answer += 1
    answer += 10
    answer *= 10
    answer = answer shr 3
    println(answer)
}
```
